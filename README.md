# UnionPhysics
A general-purpose physics engine to be part of UnionSDK, a toolset for developing scientific software in C/C++.

## Overview
UnionPhysics is a general-purpose physics engine meant for UnionSDK, a meta-project I'm building to help aid the development of
"scientific software" (in the broadest sense). Each project is meant to be easy to use with either C or C++, while sharing the core headers.
However, these <i>will obviously<i> take time to implement, so please bear with me if you see some blank repos.
